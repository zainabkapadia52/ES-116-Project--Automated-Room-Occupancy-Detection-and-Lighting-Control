# ES-116-Project--Automated-Room-Occupancy-Detection-and-Lighting-Control
This repository contains the code and documentation for an ES116 project focused on automating room occupancy detection and controlling lighting using Arduino, laser modules, and photodiodes. The system tracks occupancy, manages lighting through a relay module, and logs energy consumption data to promote efficient energy use.
